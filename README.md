# Blackjack-game

This git repository contains the source code for a blackjack game exercise from Scrimba.com. The game is built using JavaScript and HTML/CSS, and allows users to play against the computer in a classic game of blackjack. The code has been extensively commented for clarity, and is designed to be easy to follow and modify for those new to programming. Feel free to fork the repo and make your own improvements to the game!
